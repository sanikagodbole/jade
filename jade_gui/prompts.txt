Create a streamlit app

This app is for short films for with small teams to help organize assets and their many versions.
Small teams use softwares such as Autodesk MAYA, Houdini, Substance Painter, & Nuke and will work with all their file types
I am making this app for a short film set in a forest setting and the theme of the app should correspond with nature themes

This app should have the following elements: 


1. Title: JADE
2. title description: An App To Streamline USD Asset Organization & Delivery Pipeline
3. File Path Input Box to choose a base folder 
4. A Widget with 3 vertical sections in the ratio, 15:35:50
4a. First section should have two links- "New Asset" and "Publish Asset"
4b1. Second section, if "New Asset" is selected, create a form containing "Asset Type" dropdown menu with options [Character, Prop, Set], a text entry widget "Asset Name" and a button "Create Asset"
4b2. Second section, if "Publish Asset" is selected, create a  form containing "Asset Type" dropdown menu with options same as above, "Asset Name" dropdown menu which will read unique assets under the base folder, "Department" dropdown menu which will have the options [Geo, Rig,Tex] and a "Publish Asset" button
5. The third section should have a directory viewer showing all the folders under the base folder
5a. In the third section, Add expand and collapse buttons to expand and collapse the directory structure
6. Break the code into modular functions
7. Add empty handlers when buttons are clicked. 
8. Make it pretty using colors and icons,
